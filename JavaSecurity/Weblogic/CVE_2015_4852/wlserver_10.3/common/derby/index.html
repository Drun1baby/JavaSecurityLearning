this javadoc if your application runs on
J2SE 1.4, or J2SE 5.0. Also consult this javadoc if your
application runs with the Java ME CDC/Foundation 1.1 Profile (JSR-169).</li>
<li><a href="javadoc/jdbc4/index.html">JDBC 4.0 Public API</a> - Consult this
javadoc if your application runs on Java SE 6.</li>
</ul>
